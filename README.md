# filmgui (Software Project FS 2017)
The main goal of this project was to provide a user interface with which the user can load movies and analyse them with already available annotations which can, for example, describe the film hierarchy (sequences -> scenes -> shots)

### Welcome Screen
The Welcome Screen is used to provide an easy to use starting point for the user
